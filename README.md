# An ACT-R model of the role of reinforcement learning in solving RAPM problems

This is an ACT-R model that shows how reinforcement learning parameters (and, in particular, 
sensititivity to negative feedback) shape the solving of Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices (RAPM),
a common test of fluid intelligence.
