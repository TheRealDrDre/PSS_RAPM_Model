1. What if we remove *all* positive feedback? That would explain why D1
   is not effective. In this case, the only feedback is an internal
   check on whether we are making progress or not. Of course, this
   will work only on selection3/4 variants of the BG-hook algorithm. 


2. What if we change the "pick-continue" evaluation in devel5/model3 
   to "pick-its-enough"? In this case, high D1 would result ib
   abnormally high expectations on being done.
