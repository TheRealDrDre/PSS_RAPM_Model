;;   3.   Collect the values of tyhe property across first row/column
;;   4.   Find a property.
;;   5.     Find a rule for that property.
;;          Verify rule on second row/column
;;             If rule is verified, create a chunk that links feature, direction, and rule. Go
;;          How do we know that we have examined all the features?
;;             when we cannot retrieve a single feature, for instance. Or when we cannot retrieve a single feature that has not been examined.
