;;; ==================================================================
;;; A model of RAPM
;;; ==================================================================
;;; An ACT-R model that solves Raven's (Advanced) Progressive Matrices
;;; in a human-like fashion. It also explains the correlation with
;;; PSS 
;;;
;;; To dos:
;;;
;;;    1. [DONE] Generate a missing cell when the rule has been found.
;;;
;;;    2. [DONE--not pretty] Decide to examine row or column for a
;;;       given feature.
;;;
;;;    3. [Done] Trigger rewards for new feature when no solution is
;;;       found.  Trigger when a new solution is found too (maybe
;;;       only when solution is found). 
;;;
;;;    4. [Done] Identify rules much like features. This likely 
;;;       requires some lisp code on the side. Some ideas are there. 
;;;
;;;    5. [Done]---Four rules] Add a consistent set of rules. 
;;;
;;;    6. [Done] Add serious verification rules
;;;
;;;    7. [Done---four rule] Add larger set of generation rules for missing cell.
;;;
;;;    8. Needs to insist on same feature when one rule fails
;;;       (but prevent the rule from being reused)
;;;
;;;    9. Find better algorithm for pick/don't pick. Better one would
;;;       be incremental vetting (pick a feature, then vet pick/dont,
;;;       then repeat).
;;;
;;; Bugs:
;;;
;;;    1. [Fixed] Sometimes evaluation of a second solution fails.

;;; RULE VERIFICATION
;;; ----------------------------------------------------------------
;;; A rule is verified when it is consistent with the features of
;;; three cells. The verification process roughly follows this
;;; algorithm:
;;;   1. Move the tentative solution (contents of the imaginal buffer)
;;;      to the retrieval. This free the resources for the imaginal.
;;;   2. Scan the first row, cell by cell.
;;;   3. For each cell a special 'verify*RULE' production should be
;;;      called (need to write one for each rule)
;;;   4. Repeat for the second row.
;;;   5. If the second row is finished, the rule is verified.
